## Documentation Build Guide

This guide provides information for developers who want to contribute to the Instinct Docs site. The docs use [rocm-docs-core](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-docs-core) as their base and the below guide will show how you can build and serve the docs locally for testing.

### Building and Serving the Docs

Create a Python Virtual Environment (optional, but recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv/docs
```

Activate the Virtual Environment:

```bash
source .venv/docs/bin/activate # Unix-like OS
```

```bash
source .venv/docs/Scripts/activate # Git Bash on Windows
```

```bash
.venv\docs\Scripts\activate # Command Prompt on Windows
```

Install required packages for docs:

```bash
pip install -r docs/sphinx/requirements.txt
```

Build the docs:

```bash
python3 -m sphinx -b html -d _build/doctrees -D language=en ./docs/ docs/_build/html
```

Serve docs locally on port 8000:

```bash
python3 -m http.server -d ./docs/_build/html/
```

You can now view the docs site by going to <http://localhost:8000>

### Auto-building the docs

The below will allow you to watch the docs directory and rebuild the documentation each time you make a change to the documentation files:

Install Sphinx Autobuild package:

 ```bash
 pip install sphinx-autobuild
 ```

Run the autobuild (will also serve the docs on `http://localhost:8000/` automatically):

 ```bash
 sphinx-autobuild -b html -d _build/doctrees -D language=en ./docs docs/_build/html --ignore "docs/_build/*" --ignore "docs/sphinx/_toc.yml" --ignore "docs/sphinx/requirements.txt"
 ```

### Troubleshooting

#### Navigation Menu not displaying new links

Note that if you've recently added a new link to the navigation menu previously unchanged pages may not correctly display the new link. To fix this delete the existing `_build/` directory and rebuild the docs so that the navigation menu will be rebuilt for all pages.
